# Quick start

1. Prepare the scene and the object you want to break
2. Add the `Breaker` component to your GameObject
3. Add `Break By Click Collider`
4. Run the scene and click on the object to break it

{% include video.html youtube="O5hpIKY-d5w" %}

## Demo scene

In case you would like to see the result even faster, you could use the `Demo` scene.

Just open it from the `` folder. There you will find a simple scene with a placeholder for objects and a camera.
You can put your own objects in the placeholder to see how they break or simply press the `Play` button to see the
default objects breaking.
